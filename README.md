# OrangeSum Dataset
French Abstractive Summarization Dataset.

This repository contains the code to download and preprocess the data from our paper [BARThez: a Skilled Pretrained French Sequence-to-Sequence Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12321). <br> 
The code will be available soon. In the meanwhile the dataset can be provided upon request. Please contact me at moussa.kamal-eddine@polytehnique.edu
